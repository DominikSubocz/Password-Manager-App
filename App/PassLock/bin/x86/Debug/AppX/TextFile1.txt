1. Length Check:
"Your password must be at least 8 characters long."
"Passwords shorter than 8 characters are too easy to guess. Please make it longer."
2. Uppercase Letter Check:
"Your password must include at least one uppercase letter."
"Please add at least one capital letter to your password for better security."
3. Digit Check:
"Your password must contain at least one digit (0-9)."
"For stronger security, include at least one number in your password."
4. Special Character Check:
"Your password must include at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $)."
"Please add a special character to your password to enhance its strength."
5. Common Password Check:
"Your password matches a commonly used password. Please choose something more unique."
"This password is too common and may be easily guessed. Try something more complex."
6. Similarity to Common Passwords:
"Your password is too similar to a common password. Please choose a more distinct password."
"The password you’ve entered closely resembles a commonly used password, making it less secure."
7. Repetition of Characters:
"Your password contains repeated characters in a pattern that could weaken its security. Try a more random combination."
"Avoid using repeated characters or sequences like 'aaa' to improve your password's strength."
8. Sequential Patterns (like q1w2e3r4):
"Avoid using sequential patterns like 'q1w2e3r4.' These are predictable and reduce your password's strength."
"Sequential patterns in your password make it easier to guess. Please use a more random sequence."
9. Password Strength Feedback:
"Your password is weak. Consider using a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters."
"Your password could be stronger. Try increasing the length and adding more diverse characters."

Your password contains a common password phrase.
